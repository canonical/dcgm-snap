description: |
  This snap includes NVIDIA DCGM and DCGM-Exporter to manage and monitor NVIDIA GPUs via the CLI or via Prometheus metrics.
  Grafana dashboards can then be used to visualize the exported metrics, see for example:\
  https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12239-nvidia-dcgm-exporter-dashboard/

  The snap includes the following components:
  - DCGM: Data Center GPU Manager
  - DCGM-Exporter: a Prometheus exporter for DCGM metrics

  Please see the links at the bottom of the page for more details about the included components and their purpose.

  **How-To**
  ---

  **How to select a channel:**

  You need to have NVIDIA drivers installed on your system to use this snap.\
  You can check the version of your NVIDIA driver with the command:

     cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version

  With that information, you can check the compatible CUDA version here:\
  https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/minor-version-compatibility.html

  Keep in mind that:
  DCGM v4 has different releases for different CUDA versions. E.g. if your system has the Driver\
  version >= 580 it uses CUDA 13, so you should install the snap from the channel `v4-cuda13`

     sudo snap install dcgm --channel=v4-cuda13/stable

  DCGM v3 ships a single package with binaries that works from CUDA 10 up to CUDA 12.

  **How to install the snap:**

     sudo snap install dcgm --channel=<CHANNEL>

  **How to enable metrics collection:**

     # Start the DCGM-Exporter service (disabled by default)
     sudo snap start dcgm.dcgm-exporter

     # Get the metrics
     curl -s localhost:9400/metrics

  **How to configure the snap services:**

  The NV-Hostengine and DCGM-Exporter services can be configured via the `snap` CLI.\
  For example:

     # Get all the configuration options
     sudo snap get dcgm

     # Set the NV-Hostengine port
     sudo snap set dcgm nv-hostengine-port=5577

     # Restart the NV-Hostengine service to apply the changes
     sudo snap restart dcgm.nv-hostengine

  **Reference**
  ---

  Available configurations options:

  - `nv-hostengine-port`: the port on which the NV-Hostengine listens.
    The default is `5555`.
  - `dcgm-exporter-address`: the address DCGM-Exporter binds to.
    The default is `:9400`.
  - `dcgm-exporter-metrics-file`: the name of a custom CSV metrics file to be loaded by the exporter.
    The path is assumed to be `/var/snap/dcgm/common/`.
    The default metrics are located in `/snap/dcgm/current/etc/dcgm-exporter/default-counters.csv`.
    Please refer to the DCGM-Exporter repository link at the bottom of the page for more information on the CSV file format.

  **Cryptography**
  ---

  During the snap build process, snapcraft downloads the CUDA keyring deb package using `curl` over HTTPS and verifies its integrity using SHA256 checksums.
  The CUDA keyring deb package is then used to set up the appropriate source for the DCGM deb package, whose signature is verified using the keyring.\
  For more information, see the CUDA keyring repository link and `curl` documentation at the bottom of the page.
